This happens regularly in <it>February,</it> which is more often pronounced \ˈfe-b(y)ə-ˌwer-ē\ than \ˈfe-brə-ˌwer-ē\, though all of these variants are in frequent use and widely accepted. The \y\ heard from many speakers is not an intrusion but rather a common pronunciation of the vowel <it>u</it> after a consonant, as in <it>January</it> and <it>annual.</it></pt></entry>
